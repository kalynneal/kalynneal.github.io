<h1>Who Inspires Me?</h1> 
<h4><em>Steve Erwin</em></h4>
<p>If I'm being honest, I had a really hard time conming up with someone to write this about. 
There aren't many famous people I keep up with, and I'm not sure that many have even made an meaningful impact on me. 
While I don't nessecarily know what I want to do out of college, and am not directly pursuing animal conservation. 
Someone who's world view has really impressed and inspired me was Steve Erwin.</p>

<p>He was so passionate about about everyhting he did. You could tell he had found his place in life, and had no doubts about his path.
