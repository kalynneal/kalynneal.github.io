    <h1>Kinda Amusing</h1>
    <p>by Kalyn</p>

    <p>This page contains some things on the internet I find interesting.</p>

    <h2><em>Cool Math Games</em></h2>
    <p>This website should bring back some core elementary school memories for all the late 90's and early 2000's kids.
        If it doesn't, I honestly question what type of childhood you had.

    <h2><em>TikTok</em></h2>
    <p>Everyone probably already knows what TikTok is and I will never admit how much time I waste on it. 
        It is definetly an app you use on your phone more than a website you visit on a computer, but still.</p>

    </p>

    <h2><em>Food Network</em></h2>
    <p>On a more serious note, I love cooking and baking and grew up watching food network shows with my family, so this one 
        is both interesting/useful and has good memories.
