<h1>Who Inspires Me?</h1> 
<h4><em>Steve Irwin</em></h4>
<p> If I'm being honest, I had a really hard time coming up with someone to write this about. 
There aren't many famous people I keep up with, and I'm not sure that many have even made an meaningful impact on me. 
While I don't nessecarily know what I want to do out of college, and am not directly pursuing animal conservation. 
Someone who's world view has really impressed and inspired me was Steve Irwin.</p>

<p> He was so passionate about everyhting he did. You could tell he had found his place in life, and had no doubts about his path.
 If you listen to any of his speeches, his love for the world is contagious.
People who have this faith in humanity and nature are rare, which is why they stand out so much. 
He devoted his whole life to what he loved which will truly leave a lasting impression on the world.
I fully think it may be impossible to find a person that dislikes Steve Irwin, how can you? While I can't say I will follow his path directly, 
whenever I need a little motivation or faith in humanity, I know he's someone to turn to.</p>
