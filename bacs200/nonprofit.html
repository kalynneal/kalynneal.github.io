                        Senior Seminar is a somewhat generic term, so you may be asking yourself what I am talking
                        about. Well, the senior seminar I am refering to is
                        an experiential education program for seniors in high school. Specifically the one I experienced
                        at Golden High School in Golden, CO. It creates an opportunity for students to take their
                        learning outside of the classroom and experience things they normally wouldn't.

                        Senior Seminar at Golden Highschool was started by Dewain Wood in 1972 and has had a senior
                        class participate in it every year since. It is led by a group of about 3 teachers each year who
                        coordinate the trips/experiences. Students apply for the program and only 25 are chosen based on
                        staff approval, acedemic record, and senior standing. Once the students are chosen, their senior
                        year schedule is changed to fit with the program. The first semester of their senior year is
                        still mostly done in school, but their curriculum and classes are chosen to prepare the students
                        for second semester.

                        "Through experiential learning, we cross
                        cultural and classroom boundaries to solve
                        problems, collaborate and communicate
                        within and outside of the group, expanding
                        our school experience to the community and
                        beyond."
