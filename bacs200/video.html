                        Hi! My name is Kalyn Neal. I’m 20 years old and am currently a Junior at the University of
                        Northern Colorado studying
                        business management with HR and Digital Marketing certifications.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="text-success">Background:</h4>
                    <p>I grew up in Golden, Colorado, and graduated from Golden High School in 2019. I love the
                        outdoors, and grew up camping
                        and hiking with my parents, younger sister, and dog. I had many jobs growing up, such as working
                        at an amusement park,
                        nannying, and retail for multiple years. I currently work for JBS at the corporate office here
                        in Greeley. I am a part
                        of the career development program there and am running the Vendor Management department with
                        another intern.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-success">Skills:</h4>
                    <p>I consider myself a pretty well-rounded person and have picked up many skills throughout my life.
                        I am a great listener
                        which helps me focus and be detailed oriented. I am a people person and am very good at handling
                        emotions so I am good
                        at deescalating situations and making people feel at ease. I am a versatile and fast learner
                        which helps me to excel in
                        situations that I may get thrown into abruptly. Coming from my experience with JBS, I am skilled
                        with SAP functions and
                        am able to navigate the program efficiently. Lastly, I am hardworking and once I make a
                        commitment or start a project I
                        am determined to finish it.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="text-success">What can I do for you?:</h4>
                    <p>If I were to join your team, one of the most important things I would bring to the table is an
                        open mind and new
                        perspectives. I have had many unique experiences which allows me to constantly be thinking from
                        different point of
                        views. I am always open to new opportunities and will never turn down the chance for a new
                        adventure.
                    </p>
